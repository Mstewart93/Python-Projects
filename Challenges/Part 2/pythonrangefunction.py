#The Python range( ) function generates a list of numbers, which is generally used to iterate over with for loops. In other words, using it creates the list of index numbers that you can then use in a for loop.
#The range( ) function has two different sets of parameters that can be used as follows:
#range(stop)
#stop: The number of integers to generate, starting from zero.
#range([start], stop[, step]) //notice how the optional parameters are enclosed in [ ]
#start: The starting number of the sequence.
#stop: The number specifying where the sequence will stop. This is not inclusive (meaning, it doesn't include the number specified).
#step: The difference between each number in the sequence. This is basically the ‘count by’ number.
#Note that:
#All parameters must be integers.
#All parameters can be positive or negative.
#The stop parameter is not the number the function will stop on. It specifies that it will stop before the sequence reaches this number.
